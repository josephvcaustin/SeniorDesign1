1) Have GUI not hog as many resources

1.1) Space for readouts
	Current speed
	Current heading
	IR sensor readings
	Camera turn detection 

2) Get WASD interface working as well
	Incremental, letting off key -> decremental

3) Add speed sent and speed read visualization (like volume visualizer)

4) Fix D-Pad not showing up

5) Break up interface into individual objects

6) Add code in arduino for getting/setting constants
6.1) OR just store constants in a text file, more robust.

7) Add code for setting constant to add to threshold point for camera
7.1) Add camera visualization to GUI?
